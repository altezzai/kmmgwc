        Krishna Menon Memorial Government Women’s College proudly possesses a rich and illustrious green campus which is unique among other institutions of higher education in Malabar region. The campus is lustrous with a vast throng of rare species of trees and other vegetation. Some of the trees are aged more than hundred years and are truly rare.  The college maintains an eco-park which hosts quite a number of wildlife, medicinal plants, creepers, traditional trees like mango trees, jackfruit trees, and coconut palms and so on. The site is spread across an area of 15 acres which performs as the lungs of the city of Kannur.

        The plan for the Eco-Park has been prepared with the intent to balance its role as a city level educational space, with the need for the park to help mitigate some of the adverse impacts of urbanization of the surrounding area. The Eco-Park in the campus has been developed to re-establish a healthy, self-sustaining eco-system where education and eco life go hand in hand. The clean and green campus is a relieving avenue for everyone who happened to visit here. The college upholds the slogan ‘Clean Campus Green Campus’ which has been applauded by many especially by the Election Commission of Kerala. It was from here the idea of conducting a green election started in the general elections held in 2016.
        
        The college has been conducting various programmes to keep the campus clean and green always. In the first phase there is a complete cleaning drive involving all stakeholders. Each department is assigned a specific area to keep it clean and tidy. The formation of Green Army is an important step with the intention of maintaining the greenery of the campus, selecting two green volunteers from each class. The supervision of the Green Army is entrusted with selected faculty. There have been continuous mobilization programmes with the slogan My Campus My Earth. Students are given training to separate plastic waste for recycling. Several green competitions are conducted for the students such as poster making, drawing etc with green themes. Another important initiative is the survey with the objective of creating a Synthetic Pad Free Campus. The second phase includes installing waste bins and pet bottle booths throughout the campus. Putting green sign boards at important points and making alternative goods to synthetic articles are also included. The cleanest classroom will be recognised with an award. As part of the third phase, Thumboormuzhi waste composting points are made at selected points, hanging indoor plants inside classrooms and corridors, green auditing and adding nomenclature to plants are done. Diversification of the forest and creating a butterfly garden also are a couple of envisioned initiatives of the Green Army.
        
        A green campus will look to ventilate the classrooms naturally by going for a high-ceiling construction and allowing more sunlight. Plus, classrooms will be well-lit with the proper use of technology that will directly improve the well-being of the students in this institute. This will increase the overall health of students, reduce absenteeism due to positive ambiance, and result in better engagement due to hands-on activity-oriented learning. In fact, studies have shown that students of sustainability with active green campuses have better knowledge retention capacity, environmental behaviours, community sense, and skills. A green campus is a place where environmentally responsible practice and education go hand in hand and where environmentally responsible tenets are borne out by example. The institution is a laboratory of self-scrutiny, experimentation, and application. At its best, it is a model environmental community where operational functions, business practices, academic programs, and people are interlinked, providing educational and practical value to the institution, the region, and the world. Greening the campus is about sweeping away wasteful inefficiencies and ushering in positive changes. Many of these changes address the daily, practical aspects of campus life. The Green Campus programme is a golden opportunity to develop an exciting new curriculum that encourages students to take the lead in creating positive change and, at the same time, to gain invaluable, marketable skills. Our students, particularly those who hope to work in the environmental field, are the key ingredient for a successful programme. Students can team up with faculty and experienced personnel from government agencies, utilities, and private industry to conduct environmental evaluations of the campus. The green campus concept is a breath of fresh air in a change towards a sustainable campus. The application of this concept can bring in a positive change in both teaching and learning activities. Green campus programmes enable this college to conserve natural resources like water and biodiversity, optimize energy efficiency, manage waste and educate about climate change and sustainability while addressing the well-being of the students.
        
        The college has Haritha Mission which integrates the components of waste management, organic farming and water resources management. It has an ambitious outlook to address the issues of piling waste, impending drought and health hazards due to the consumption of pesticide treated vegetables and in general, the agricultural dependency of the state. The institution owns Suchithwa Mission with the motto My Waste My Responsibility. The stakeholders realize that waste management is an important part especially for the city dwellers. Managing food and bio degradable waste at college, keeping non bio degradable waste clean and dry and handing over to scrap dealers or local body collection systems are as important as consuming food. Once the plastic wastes are sorted, the Kannur Corporation agencies will arrange to pick them. Food wastes generated are collected by pig farm agents leaving no such wastes in the campus. Weekly cleaning programmes are conducted by the NSS units on every Saturdays. The activities of Nature Club and Tourism Club are coordinated in the process of keeping the campus clean and green. Recently the college has come up with an initiative with the collaboration of Kerala State Forest Institute (KFRI) which will help the institute in maintaining the greenness of the campus. Several park benches are placed at different points in the campus where the students can spend their leisure blending with the green nature in the campus.
        
        Vidhyavanam is another recent venture of the institute in collaboration with the Department of Forestry, Kerala.    </pre
