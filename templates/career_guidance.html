        Career guidance & Placement cell is to provide ample opportunities to the students for upgrading their skills. 
        The real aim of formal education in the modern context is also to make the students ready for jobs or self-reliance 
        in addition to their physical, mental and spiritual development. There is a need to provide a platform for the students 
        in the institution where they are studying.
