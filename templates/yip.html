        Young Innovators Program (YIP) is a flagship program as part of the innovation segment that 
        aims to empower future innovators to innovate new products, services, or models to meet 
        emerging requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs of the society more 
        effectively through specially designed challenges. Fostering innovation involves enhancing 
        participants’ creative thinking while promoting collaborative, human-centered, real-life, 
        and interdisciplinary problem-solving within frameworks like design-thinking, bricolage, 
        and maker spaces. It emphasizes core STEM values, including scientific temper, embracing 
        uncertainty, recognizing ambiguity, and learning from past and present failures. Additionally, 
        it focuses on developing workforce programs to improve employability and adaptability to 
        emerging forms of work.
